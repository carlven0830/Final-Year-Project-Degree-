This is a research project, titled "Malware analysis with machine learning".

The database I use is Malware Training Sets.
Here the link you can download dataset: https://github.com/marcoramilli/MalwareTrainingSets/tree/master/trainingSets

The feature selection I use is Boruta.

The machine learning I used to train the model:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting

After training the model, I use REST API to do a application to analysis the malware.

If you want to see the code, you can find the code file here. If anything you do not know, you can view Read Me file.
